# Flappy-Bird ( Work in progress )

Hi. My name is LRC and I've made this project based on learning-by-doing method and free assests from the web. I'm trying to learn Unity and C# through making projects and facing the challenges. I'm trying to improve the game and add new features every 2 days. Shoutout to Mark Brown for his wonderful tutorial video. Here is the link, If you're interested ( You'll find it useful, Trust me^-^ ):
